# Usage ALert

This path is where when npm installed parts, template referenced components, and custom modifications are done in minor UI elements. 

AiChatbot, Chatbot, and Video call files are only ones that hold most significance here.

As for other files...... Please do not waste your time here if you are first diving into this codebase becuase none of the files would make any sense to you in your first time, unless you are super senior tech guru.

The only time you should visit this path is when you are checking the app router directory and you wanna debig and check components of related pages, then you come here with ctrl + click on imports.
