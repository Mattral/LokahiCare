# Usage Alert

Of all the things you see here, only schedule path is used, 

Other directories are just where I tested how things will go and, ended up failing to anyways.

I am keeping codes here just to debug why they are failing later.

Please do not bother debugging paths other than 'Schedule'

If you want to route to where the video call in this web is arranged, kindly follow this path
[src/app/(dashboard)/session/page.tsx] where video call is implemented. 

The reason I keep in different route is because it is not folowing the same import requirements as the things placed here and, to avoid the confusion regarding imports
